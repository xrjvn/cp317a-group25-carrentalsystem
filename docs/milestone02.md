## 1) Abstract
The **Car Rental System** project enables customers to search, reserve, and manage vehicle rentals through an intuitive interface, while giving managers tools to view daily activity and generate fleet-usage reports.  

This milestone expands on the previous deliverable by refining requirements, introducing a fully structured **Product Backlog**, defining **functional and non-functional requirements**, elaborating on **ethical considerations**, and presenting **initial UI design sketches** that visualize core interactions of the system.

## 2) Product Backlog (Expanded)
The initial backlog from Milestone 01 has been enhanced to include **Story Points, Priority, Sprint Assignment, Status, Conversation**, and **Confirmation (Acceptance Criteria)**.  
It is maintained in **`Group25-ProductBacklog.xlsx`** and summarized below.

### Backlog Summary (Excerpt)
| Story ID | Story Title | Story Points | Priority | Sprint Assignment | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|---------|

### üí° Methodology Notes

- **Sprint Assignment:** Sprint 1 focuses on core customer features (search, reserve, login); Sprint 2 on modifications and profiles; Sprint 3 on manager reports.  
- **Conversation / Confirmation:** Provide notes and acceptance criteria for each story to align team understanding and testing criteria.  
- **Status:** Initially ‚ÄúNot Started‚Äù for all stories; to be updated in later milestones.  

The complete backlog with full user stories and details is included in the Excel file **`Group25-ProductBacklog.xlsx`**.
