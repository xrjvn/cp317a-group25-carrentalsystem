**Group 25 – Car Rental System**  

## 1. Abstract
Our project is a **Car Rental System** that allows customers to search, reserve, and manage car rentals through a user-friendly platform. The system also provides rental managers with tools to monitor daily rentals, track utilization of cars, and generate reports.

This project is important because many rental companies still use outdated manual processes that cause inefficiency and inconvenience. Our solution digitizes the process, offering customers greater convenience and enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions.

## 4. Ethical Considerations
1. **Data Privacy** – Customer information and booking data must be stored securely. We will use encryption and authentication to protect personal data.
2. **Accessibility** – The platform will be designed to support accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility and clear navigation to ensure inclusivity.
3. **Fairness** – The system will ensure fair access for all customers without bias in pricing, availability, or services.


## 5. Team Blog
The team blog is maintained separately as an **Excel file** (``).
It contains team information that will be updated regularly throughout the semester to track progression.
